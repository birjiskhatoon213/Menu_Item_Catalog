#Menu_Item_Catalog Project This project is about creating restaurant menu website which can allow us to add,edit,delete restaurants and its menu items.

###Before starting our project we need to download some softwares *Virtual Box *Vagrant

###Vagrant: Vagrant provides the same, easy workflow regardless of your role as a developer, operator, or designer. It leverages a declarative configuration file which describes all your software requirements, packages, operating system configuration, users, and more.

Heres a link to downlaod vagrant

###Virtual Box: Download the Virtual Box from this link

###After downloading both vagrant and virtual box

Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm 2.Open a terminal and change your directory to /FSND-Virtual-Machine/vagrant using cd. 3.And start using these commands *vagrant up(This will downlaod the desired os image and
install it the downlaod will be taken place once and after that this command will always be used to open the virtual box) *vagrant ssh (This will start our virtual machine) 4.Make sure on changing the directory to /vagrant(The place in which the files can be accesed by both host and virtual machine) 5.After that create your own folder for the project i created menu_item and change the directory to it.
###How to work on this project:

Create a database using sql alchemy and save it as databasesetup.py and run it.
After that push data into the database using lotsofmenus.py.
Create static and template folder to store 'css' and 'html' files which we can use in our program.
Create a file project.py and the code which describes how our application works.
After exceuting python project.py we can access the restaurant menu application at localhost:5000/. 6.That's how we created and use the menu app.
